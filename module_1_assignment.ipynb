        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
        "  >. Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language that emphasizes readability and simplicity. Python's syntax is clean and easy to understand, which makes it ideal for beginners and helps developers write clear and maintainable code.\n",
        "  It is very popular because very easy to learn and it has biggest number of library, it's simplicity and flexibility of python allow developer to create and develop code quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
        "   >. An interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine code that the computer can understand and execute. Unlike compiled languages (such as C or Java), where the code is first compiled into a separate executable file, Python code is executed directly by the interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "  >. In Python, pre-defined keywords are words that have special meaning and are reserved for specific syntactic purposes. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, function names, etc.) because they are integral to the structure of the Python language. They are case-sensitive and must be written exactly as specified.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
        "  >. No, keywords in Python cannot be used as variable names. Keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in Python, and they are part of the syntax of the language. For example, words like if, else, class, def, return, import, etc., are keywords, and they cannot be used as variable names because they are already predefined with specific meanings.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python ?\n",
        " >. In Python, mutability refers to the ability of an object to be changed or modified after it has been created. Some objects in Python are mutable, meaning their contents can be modified, while others are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed once they are created.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "  >. Lists are meant to be mutable, meaning that their contents can be changed after they are created. This flexibility allows lists to be used in situations where the data may need to change over time (e.g., adding, removing, or modifying elements).\n",
        "\n",
        "  >.Tuples, on the other hand, are designed to be immutable. Once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be modified. This immutability offers benefits in terms of performance, safety, and integrity. Tuples are often used to represent fixed collections of data (such as coordinates, records, etc.) where the data shouldn't change.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n",
        "  >. In Python, both == and is are comparison operators, but they serve different purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. == (Equality operator):\n",
        "\n",
        "    This operator checks if the values of two objects are equal. It compares the contents of the objects.\n",
        "    It works by calling the __eq__ method of the objects involved to determine if they have the same value.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2. is (Identity operator):\n",
        "\n",
        "    This operator checks if two references point to the same object in memory, i.e., if they are the same instance.\n",
        "    It compares the identity of the objects, not their values.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
        " >.In Python, logical operators are used to combine conditional statements or expressions. They allow you to perform logical operations to determine the truth value (True or False) of a given condition. The two main logical operators in Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "      and:\n",
        "      The and operator returns True if both operands (conditions) are true. If either of the conditions is false, it returns False.\n",
        "\n",
        "      or:\n",
        "      The or operator returns True if at least one of the operands is true. If both are false, it returns False.\n",
        "  \n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python ?\n",
        "  >. In Python, type casting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. This can be done explicitly by using built-in functions to convert between types.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
        "   >. Conditional statements in Python, such as if, elif, and else, are used to control the flow of a program based on specific conditions or criteria. They allow the program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code depending on whether certain conditions are true or false. This is essential for handling different situations and making the program respond dynamically to various inputs or states.\n",
        "  \n",
        "11.  How does the elif statement work ?\n",
        "  >.The elif (short for \"else if\") statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions in a sequence, following an initial if statement. It allows you to test multiple expressions for truth values and execute a block of code as soon as one of those conditions evaluates to True. If none of the if or elif conditions are true, the final else block (if present) will be executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n",
        "   >. In Python, both for and while loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times, but they work in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "   for loop:\n",
        "   This loop is typically used when you know how many times you want to iterate. It iterates over a sequence and executes the block of code for each element in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "     while loop:\n",
        "     This loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code while a condition is true. The number of iterations is not predetermined and depends on the condition being checked.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop ?\n",
        "  >. A scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop is when you need to repeat an action until a condition changes, but you don't know in advance how many iterations it will take.\n",
